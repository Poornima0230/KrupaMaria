        <p>
          I believe that knowledge grows when shared — that teaching and
          outreach are not extensions of research, but integral to it. Sharing
          ideas with broader audiences keeps me grounded, inspired, and
          connected to the larger purpose of science: to empower people and
          improve lives.
        </p>
        <h3>Mentorship and Community Teaching</h3>
        <p>
          Beyond IIT Madras, I have extended my teaching to wider audiences
          through free weekly tutorial sessions for M.Sc. Mathematics students
          preparing for national-level exams such as GATE and CSIR NET–JRF.
          These sessions, conducted at the<b> University of Madras</b>, aim to
          make high-quality mathematical training more accessible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many of my mentors have gone on to join premier research institutions
          across India, and seeing their growth has been one of the most
          fulfilling aspects of my academic journey. These experiences reaffirm
          my belief that teaching is an act of empowerment — that education,
          when shared freely, multiplies opportunity and builds community.
        </p>
        <h3>Workshops and Talks</h3>
        <p>
          I regularly conduct workshops introducing high school and college
          students to the fascinating world of Game Theory — often blending
          problem-solving with storytelling to make the subject more
          approachable and enjoyable.
        </p>
        <p className="small-para">Some memorable sessions include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <i>Lessons in Mathematical Games and Winning Strategies</i>—
            Kendriya Vidyalaya, Chennai (2025)
          </li>
          <li>
            <i>Introductory Game Theory</i> — Alphonsa College, St. Thomas
            College, and St. George’s College (2023)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Science Communication</h3>
        <p>
          As part of my outreach, I also enjoy writing expository pieces that
          bring mathematical ideas to a broader audience. I authored two
          articles introducing game theory to undergraduate students:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>
              Game On: How Strategies Shape Our World? Part I – Basics of
              Strategic Interaction
            </b>{" "}
            <i>(Communicated)</i>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>
              Game On: How Strategies Shape Our World? Part II – Applications
              Across Science and Society{" "}
            </b>
            <i>(Communicated)</i>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These pieces reflect my vision of making abstract mathematical
          concepts relatable — showing how strategy, cooperation, and
          competition shape the systems we live in.
        </p>
        <h3>Philosophy</h3>
        <p>
          Whether through mentoring, workshops, or writing, I see outreach as an
          act of kindness, inclusion, and responsibility. Each student I meet,
          each classroom I visit, reminds me that science becomes truly
          meaningful only when it touches lives and expands access to learning.
