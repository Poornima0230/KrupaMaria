          Teaching mathematics has been one of the most enriching parts of my
          academic journey. Although I am passionate about research, my true
          love is teaching. At IIT Madras, I have had the privilege of teaching
          and tutoring a range of undergraduate and postgraduate courses. Each
          course has been a unique experience in communicating mathematical
          ideas to diverse groups of learners.

          I believe that teaching mathematics is not about transmitting
          knowledge but about building curiosity and confidence. A good class,
          in my view, is one where students feel safe to make mistakes,
          challenge assumptions, and find joy in reasoning.
        </p>
        <p>
          In every lecture or tutorial, I try to cultivate an atmosphere of
          patience, openness, and dialogue, where both teacher and student grow
          together. A good educator doesn’t just train minds — they inspire
          thought, empathy, and self-belief.
