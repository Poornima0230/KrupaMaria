          My vision is to make science more human — to use scientific insight to
          help people, communities, and the planet thrive. I want my research to
          move beyond theory and contribute, in small but tangible ways, to the
          betterment of lives. Through my work in game theory, I hope to build
          systems that are fairer, more sustainable, and more cooperative.
          Everyone deserves to live with dignity, and we owe that respect to our
          planet as well.

          I believe deeply in the power of education and kindness — in sharing
          knowledge, teaching with empathy, and learning from every interaction.
          To me, being a researcher is not only about discovery, but also about
          connection, and purpose. Above all, I strive to remain kind, curious,
          and thoughtful — because the way we do science is just as important as
          what we discover.
