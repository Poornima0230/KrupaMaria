        <h3>"Excellence happens not by accident. It is a process."</h3>
        <p>
          I’ve always believed that excellence is built on curiosity,
          consistency, and courage — the willingness to work hard, take risks,
          and learn from every experience.

          My academic journey has taken me through some of India’s most
          inspiring institutions, each shaping not only my mathematical thinking
          but also my perspective on life. The pluralistic and vibrant cultures
          of these places have taught me as much about communication,
          collaboration, and intercultural fluency as about analysis and proof.
